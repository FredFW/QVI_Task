If you are on a Windows\nmachine, you will need to use forward slashes (/) instead of backshashes (\\)\nfilePath <- \"\"\ntransactionData <- fread(paste0(filePath,\"QVI_transaction_data.csv\"))\ncustomerData <- fread(paste0(filePath,\"QVI_purchase_behaviour.csv\"))\n```\n## Exploratory data analysis\nThe first step in any analysis is to first understand the data. Let's take a look\nat each of the datasets provided.\n### Examining transaction data\nWe can use `str()` to look at the format of each column and see a sample of the\ndata. As we have read in the dataset as a `data.table` object, we can also run\n`transactionData` in the console to see a sample of the data or use\n`head(transactionData)` to look at the first 10 rows.\n\nLet's check if columns we would expect to be numeric are in numeric form and date\ncolumns are in date format.\n```{r Examining transaction data}\n#### Examine transaction data\n# Over to you! Examine the data using one or more of the methods described above.\n```\nWe can see that the date column is in an integer format. Let's change this to a\ndate format.\n```{r Convert DATE to date format}\n#### Convert DATE column to a date format\n#### A quick search online tells us that CSV and Excel integer dates begin on 30\nDec 1899\ntransactionData$DATE <- as.Date(transactionData$DATE, origin = \"1899-12-30\")\n```\nWe should check that we are looking at the right products by examining PROD_NAME.\n```{r Summary of PROD_NAME}\n#### Examine PROD_NAME\n# Over to you! Generate a summary of the PROD_NAME column.\n```\nLooks like we are definitely looking at potato chips but how can we check that\nthese are all chips? We can do some basic text analysis by summarising the\nindividual words in the product name.\n```{r Further examine PROD_NAME}\n#### Examine the words in PROD_NAME to see if there are any incorrect entries\n#### such as products that are not chips\nproductWords <- data.table(unlist(strsplit(unique(transactionData[, PROD_NAME]), \"\n\")))\nsetnames(productWords, 'words')\n```\nAs we are only interested in words that will tell us if the product is chips or\nnot, let's remove all words with digits and special characters such as '&' from our\nset of product words. We can do this using `grepl()`.\n```{r}\n# Over to you! Remove digits, and special characters, and then sort the distinct\nwords by frequency of occurrence.\n#### Removing digits\n#### Removing special characters\n#### Let's look at the most common words by counting the number of times a word\nappears and\n#### sorting them by this frequency in order of highest to lowest frequency\n\n```\n\nThere are salsa products in the dataset but we are only interested in the chips\ncategory, so let's remove these.\n```{r}\n#### Remove salsa products\ntransactionData[, SALSA := grepl(\"salsa\", tolower(PROD_NAME))]\ntransactionData <- transactionData[SALSA == FALSE, ][, SALSA := NULL]\n```\nNext, we can use `summary()` to check summary statistics such as mean, min and max\nvalues for each feature to see if there are any obvious outliers in the data and if\nthere are any nulls in any of the columns (`NA's : number of nulls` will appear in\nthe output if there are any nulls).\n```{r initial summary}\n#### Summarise the data to check for nulls and possible outliers\n# Over to you!\n```\nThere are no nulls in the columns but product quantity appears to have an outlier\nwhich we should investigate further. Let's investigate further the case where 200\npackets of chips are bought in one transaction.\n```{r }\n#### Filter the dataset to find the outlier\n# Over to you! Use a filter to examine the transactions in question.\n```\nThere are two transactions where 200 packets of chips are bought in one transaction\nand both of these transactions were by the same customer.\n```{r}\n#### Let's see if the customer has had other transactions\n# Over to you! Use a filter to see what other transactions that customer made.\n```\nIt looks like this customer has only had the two transactions over the year and is\nnot an ordinary retail customer. The customer might be buying chips for commercial\npurposes instead. We'll remove this loyalty card number from further analysis.\n```{r}\n#### Filter out the customer based on the loyalty card number\n# Over to you!\n#### Re-examine transaction data\n# Over to you!\n```\nThat's better. Now, let's look at the number of transaction lines over time to see\nif there are any obvious data issues such as missing data.\n```{r}\n#### Count the number of transactions by date\n# Over to you! Create a summary of transaction count by date.\n```\nThere's only 364 rows, meaning only 364 dates which indicates a missing date. Let's\ncreate a sequence of dates from 1 Jul 2018 to 30 Jun 2019 and use this to create a\nchart of number of transactions over time to find the missing date.\n```{r fig.align = \"center\"}\n#### Create a sequence of dates and join this the count of transactions by date\n# Over to you - create a column of dates that includes every day from 1 Jul 2018 to\n30 Jun 2019, and join it onto the data to fill in the missing day.\n#### Setting plot themes to format graphs\ntheme_set(theme_bw())\ntheme_update(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\n#### Plot transactions over time\nggplot(transactions_by_day, aes(x = DATE, y = N)) +\ngeom_line() +\nlabs(x = \"Day\", y = \"Number of transactions\", title = \"Transactions over time\") +\nscale_x_date(breaks = \"1 month\") +\ntheme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5))\n```\nWe can see that there is an increase in purchases in December and a break in late\nDecember. Let's zoom in on this.\n```{r fig.align = \"center\"}\n#### Filter to December and look at individual days\n# Over to you - recreate the chart above zoomed in to the relevant dates.\n```\nWe can see that the increase in sales occurs in the lead-up to Christmas and that\nthere are zero sales on Christmas day itself. This is due to shops being closed on\nChristmas day.\nNow that we are satisfied that the data no longer has outliers, we can move on to\ncreating other features such as brand of chips or pack size from PROD_NAME. We will\nstart with pack size.\n```{r Create pack size}\n#### Pack size\n#### We can work this out by taking the digits that are in PROD_NAME\ntransactionData[, PACK_SIZE := parse_number(PROD_NAME)]\n#### Always check your output\n#### Let's check if the pack sizes look sensible\ntransactionData[, .N, PACK_SIZE][order(PACK_SIZE)]\n```\nThe largest size is 380g and the smallest size is 70g - seems sensible!\n\n```{r }\n#### Let's plot a histogram of PACK_SIZE since we know that it is a categorical\nvariable and not a continuous variable even though it is numeric.\n# Over to you! Plot a histogram showing the number of transactions by pack size.\n```\nPack sizes created look reasonable.\nNow to create brands, we can use the first word in PROD_NAME to work out the brand\nname...\n```{r Create brand name}\n#### Brands\n# Over to you! Create a column which contains the brand of the product, by\nextracting it from the product name.\n#### Checking brands\n# Over to you! Check the results look reasonable.\n```\nSome of the brand names look like they are of the same brands - such as RED and\nRRD, which are both Red Rock Deli chips. Let's combine these together.\n```{r Clean brand names}\n#### Clean brand names\ntransactionData[BRAND == \"RED\", BRAND := \"RRD\"]\n# Over to you! Add any additional brand adjustments you think may be required.\n#### Check again\n# Over to you! Check the results look reasonable.\n```\n### Examining customer data\nNow that we are happy with the transaction dataset, let's have a look at the\ncustomer dataset.\n```{r 1 Exploratory data analysis}\n#### Examining customer data\n# Over to you! Do some basic summaries of the dataset, including distributions of\nany key columns.\n```\n```{r }\n#### Merge transaction data to customer data\ndata <- merge(transactionData, customerData, all.x = TRUE)\n```\nAs the number of rows in `data` is the same as that of `transactionData`, we can be\nsure that no duplicates were created. This is because we created `data` by setting\n`all.x = TRUE` (in other words, a left join) which means take all the rows in\n`transactionData` and find rows with matching values in shared columns and then\njoining the details in these rows to the `x` or the first mentioned table.\nLet's also check if some customers were not matched on by checking for nulls.\n```{r Check for missing customer details}\n# Over to you! See if any transactions did not have a matched customer.\n```\nGreat, there are no nulls! So all our customers in the transaction data has been\naccounted for in the customer dataset.\nNote that if you are continuing with Task 2, you may want to retain this dataset\nwhich you can write out as a csv\n```{r Code to save dataset as a csv}\nfwrite(data, paste0(filePath,\"QVI_data.csv\"))\n```\nData exploration is now complete!\n## Data analysis on customer segments\nNow that the data is ready for analysis, we can define some metrics of interest to\nthe client:\n- Who spends the most on chips (total sales), describing customers by lifestage and\nhow premium their general purchasing behaviour is\n- How many customers are in each segment\n- How many chips are bought per customer by segment\n- What's the average chip price by customer segment\nWe could also ask our data team for more information. Examples are:\n- The customer's total spend over the period and total spend for each transaction\nto understand what proportion of their grocery spend is on chips\n- Proportion of customers in each customer segment overall to compare against the\nmix of customers who purchase chips\nLet's start with calculating total sales by LIFESTAGE and PREMIUM_CUSTOMER and\nplotting the split by these segments to describe which customer segment contribute\nmost to chip sales.\n```{r fig.width = 10, fig.align = \"center\"}\n#### Total sales by LIFESTAGE and PREMIUM_CUSTOMER\n# Over to you! Calculate the summary of sales by those dimensions and create a\nplot.\n\n```\nSales are coming mainly from Budget - older families, Mainstream - young\nsingles/couples, and Mainstream - retirees\nLet's see if the higher sales are due to there being more customers who buy chips.\n```{r fig.width = 10, fig.align = \"center\"}\n#### Number of customers by LIFESTAGE and PREMIUM_CUSTOMER\n# Over to you! Calculate the summary of number of customers by those dimensions and\ncreate a plot.\n```\nThere are more Mainstream - young singles/couples and Mainstream - retirees who buy\nchips. This contributes to there being more sales to these customer segments but\nthis is not a major driver for the Budget - Older families segment.\nHigher sales may also be driven by more units of chips being bought per customer.\nLet's have a look at this next.\n```{r fig.width = 10, fig.align = \"center\"}\n#### Average number of units per customer by LIFESTAGE and PREMIUM_CUSTOMER\n# Over to you! Calculate and plot the average number of units per customer by those\ntwo dimensions.\n```\nOlder families and young families in general buy more chips per customer\nLet's also investigate the average price per unit chips bought for each customer\nsegment as this is also a driver of total sales.\n```{r fig.width = 10, fig.align = \"center\"}\n#### Average price per unit by LIFESTAGE and PREMIUM_CUSTOMER\n# Over to you! Calculate and plot the average price per unit sold (average sale\nprice) by those two customer dimensions.\n```\nMainstream midage and young singles and couples are more willing to pay more per\npacket of chips compared to their budget and premium counterparts. This may be due\nto premium shoppers being more likely to buy healthy snacks and when they buy\nchips, this is mainly for entertainment purposes rather than their own consumption.\nThis is also supported by there being fewer premium midage and young singles and\ncouples buying chips compared to their mainstream counterparts.\nAs the difference in average price per unit isn't large, we can check if thisdifference is statistically different.\n```{r}\n#### Perform an independent t-test between mainstream vs premium and budget midage\nand\n#### young singles and couples\n# Over to you! Perform a t-test to see if the difference is significant.\n```\nThe t-test results in a p-value of XXXXXXX, i.e. the unit price for mainstream,\nyoung and mid-age singles and couples [ARE / ARE NOT] significantly higher than\nthat of budget or premium, young and midage singles and couples.\n## Deep dive into specific customer segments for insights\nWe have found quite a few interesting insights that we can dive deeper into.\nWe might want to target customer segments that contribute the most to sales to\nretain them or further increase sales. Let's look at Mainstream - young\nsingles/couples. For instance, let's find out if they tend to buy a particular\nbrand of chips.\n```{r fig.align = \"center\"}\n#### Deep dive into Mainstream, young singles/couples\n# Over to you! Work out of there are brands that these two customer segments prefer\nmore than others. You could use a technique called affinity analysis or a-priori\nanalysis (or any other method if you prefer)\n```\nWe can see that :\n[INSIGHTS]\nLet's also find out if our target segment tends to buy larger packs of chips.\n```{r fig.align = \"center\"}\n#### Preferred pack size compared to the rest of the population\n# Over to you! Do the same for pack size.\n```\n[INSIGHTS]\n","metadata":{},"id":"e1e29595-eaa6-4602-852c-53363a032c80","cell_type":"markdown"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"R","language":"R","name":"ir"},"language_info":{"name":"R","codemirror_mode":"r","pygments_lexer":"r","mimetype":"text/x-r-source","file_extension":".r","version":"4.2.1"},"editor":"DataCamp Workspace"},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
